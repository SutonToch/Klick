A short browser-game based on the cursor. Test your concentration and hand-eye-coordination with this short game.

## Purpose
This project is mainly for personal programming practice. I wanted to created something a little more dynamic, different and fun than a normal webpage. With this, I was able to learn a lot of TypeScript, the DOM and CSS-Animations.

Originally I envisioned a far more sophisticated game, but due to time-constraints I have to put this project on pause for now.

## Vision
This short game should show everything that can be done with a cursor, in a fun way. These things do not necessarily have to be useful in any way, but should be a short reminder on how a whole world learned to use this tool "mouse" and it's digital counterpart "cursor" within a short period of time. Somehow the use of a mouse is really intuitive, and connecting hand-eye-coordination might be a solution in other fields that struggle with intuitive use.

This game should contain some kind of 'levels', each highlighting something different of what could be done with a cursor:
- evading an entity (goose?) that follows the cursor while still clicking the boxes
- smoothing cursor movement, to an extent that the movement feels slippery
- everything is dark, and the cursor acts like a torch, making you search for the boxes
- cursor becomes invisible for a short time periodically
- having a maze you have to traverse, a concept similar to a "hot wire"
- different actions you can perform instead of simple one-time-clicking:
  - drag a box somewhere
  - hover over a box for a certain amount of time
  - clicking a certain amount of time in quick succession
